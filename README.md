# Credit Information App
## Created using React.js

### INSTRUCTION
> Create an interactive interface that allows a user to explore 3 debts (car, credit card, line of credit) over and how they're paid off over the months and years. Create an interface that's engaging and is simple for the user to explore all values. It must do this without being overwhelming or confusing to the user.

>The sample data is organized into a JSON file with keys "Dates", "Credit Card","Line of Credit" and "Contributions"

>Each of the last 3 have 3 keys within them representing the interest rate of the debt, money contributed over each time period and the remaining balance on the debt over each time period.

>The very first value in the "contribution" arrays, "balance" arrays and the "dates" array represents the initial/starting value of each of the respective elements. All following values are arrays of size 12 that represent the value for each month in the year

>1) Use a GET request to fetch the JSON file from the following link: http://myjson.com/pekt6
>2) Create the necessary objects to store the data and build an interactive interface. You can use any open-source libraries
to help with this.
>3) Send a link over to the code and a way to interact with a live application. You can use repl.it or any other solution to do this
